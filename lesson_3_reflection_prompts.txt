When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    The usage of remote repository is determined by the multiple needs:
    - to be able to access the content of the repository from 
    any other computer connected to the internet
    - to allow contribution from other team members
    - to backup your important project and worry less on the local data loss

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    This way it is easier to determine that everyone started working on the same 
    version of the file and git doesnâ€™t need to worry about constant comparison
    of all the current changes. When someone in the team is finished with working 
    on his/her part others can start pulling the newly added changes.
